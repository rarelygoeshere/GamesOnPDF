# GamesOnPDF
A repository listing games that can be played on a PDF file. If the game is a port of games on different platforms, the naming scheme will list the project's official name, and then the game you can play on it. Unless otherwise specified, the projects listed are generally assumed to work on both Firefox and Chromium browsers. Feel free to make a Pull Request if you find any that aren't listed here.<br>
